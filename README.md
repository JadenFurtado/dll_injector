# dll_injector
A dll injector I developed in C++.

It currently works in Windows 10 and I guess it should work for other versions too.

I am still working on it and I will be pushing changes as and when I work on it.

I have compiled both these files into exe as you can see. Main.cpp is a test programme. Injector injects the DLL. The DLL's file name is taken as a cmd line argument.
